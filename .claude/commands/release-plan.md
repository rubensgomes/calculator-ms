# Generate Release Plan

1. If no argument is provided, respond with "Error: Git repository name is
   required." and stop.
2. If the argument is provided, check if the $ARGUMENT repository exists.
3. MUST run `scripts/test_github.sh $ARGUMENT`, and ensure it succeeds;
   otherwise, it MUST report error and stop.
4. Now, you MUST create a NEW release plan containing following steps:
    - MUST run `poetry run mypy src/` and fix any issues.
    - MUST run `poetry run isort src/ tests/` and fix any issues.
    - MUST run `poetry run black src/ tests/` and fix any issues.
    - MUST run `poetry run pytest` and fix any issues.
    - MUST run `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s); poetry build -v` and fix any issues.
    - MUST ensure a `CHANGELOG.md` file exists in the project root folder.
    - MUST update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the current release changes.
    - MUST commit all changes to main, create a new version tag, push, and create a GitHub release
5. MUST save the release plan in the project's docs folder
6. MUST mark off checkboxes as steps in the plan are completed
7. Upon completion of release plan, request user's approval
